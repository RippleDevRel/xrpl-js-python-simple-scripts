### New amendments  (`devnet/`)
Within this folder you will find scripts to interact with new amendments that are only live on DevNet and not on Testnet/Mainnet. You can find the list of amendments currently live on DevNet here: https://devnet.xrpl.org/amendments.  
**Important note**: An amendment may be live on DevNet but not yet supported by one of the XRPL libraries (Python/JS). Please check the library documentation or release notes for compatibility before using these scripts.
